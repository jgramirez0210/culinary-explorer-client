        Before embarking on my software development journey, I worked as a Project Manager in the entertainment industry.
        I enjoyed problem-solving and creating things that people would love. When I discovered software development,
        I was immediately intrigued. I realized that the tech industry would enable me to continue utilizing the skills
        I have honed such as planning, communication, and problem-solving. This sparked my passion for software, which has
        only grown stronger with every discovery.
